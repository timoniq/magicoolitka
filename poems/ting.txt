TING, THE STAR WANDERER

When Ting was a human, he was the smartest creature of the planet. He was raised away from society. After twenty years of living on earth he invented a lot things and outperformed humanity in terms of technological progress. To battle weakness of his body, he rebuilt it with everlasting materials. He built a spaceship of antigravity and travelled far into space. He could not return, as the warping of time made humanity progress and analyse space, and therefore he had to hide from them.


TING RING

Before starting hiding from dystopian civilisations, Ting had a plenty of time and so he made a ring to collect the Strange Stones he was finding in different places in space. These stones were incomprehensible by any kind of geometry or scientific logic. They were warping space and sending thoughts of other linguistics into his mind. He could know what is happening somewhere in the other part of the space as he had such a stone near himself. When interacting with those stones, his thoughts were completely deprived from representation by natural language or any sort of numbers and became something completely different. And a lot of other various effects they had. That piqued his interest for thousands of light-years and so he was travelling through space to find those stones. All of those he attached to the ring.
