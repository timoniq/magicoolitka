“Go quickly” literally means to leave quickly when one's tasks are done. The actor, at the end of his performance, leaves the stage without further delay. 

He does not wait beyond the moment when the audience requests his presence. He withdraws, detaching himself from what he has done.

This altruism forbids the ego to assume power, but preserves inner balance, and allows inner truth to prevail.
